Chatter Creek's value-priced Bordeaux blend is often his most appealing red wine upon release. This is scented with hard cherry candy and the flavors follow right on course. It needs some breathing time to open out and as it does the finish lingers with pleasing streaks of coffee and toast.,US,Red Blend
This is co-fermented Old Stones Vineyard and Cailloux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (60%) and Syrah (40%) showing the funk of the terroir and less of the varietal character of the fruit. It's flavorful and textural with earth anise and smoke notes plus a mineral-driven wet-stone base and exceptional length.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
A four-grape Bordeaux-style blend this packs 57% Cabernet Sauvignon 27% Merlot 13% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. Refined and elegant it is precisely structured with a firm herbal attack and a perfect blend of berry and cassis flavors. It's dense deep and compact suggesting long aging ahead.,US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
A wonderful 100% Cabernet this is Prime's first wine to bear the new Coombsville appellation. It's smooth elegant and complex with layers of blackberry and crème de cassis. It's beautiful now and over the next eight years.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon

A symphony of subtle accents such as powdered sugar candied citrus peel and breakfast tea this gorgeous bottle belongs with the short list of the very best of Washington's many Rieslings.,US,Riesling
This is made from fruit sourced from the oldest block of Syrah in Washington which was planted in 1986. The nose expresses complex varietal character with a mix of blue and purple berry a dusting of earth and accents of cinnamon and incense. Subtle and expressive this is the best vintage to date for the Patriarche.,US,Syrah
One of the best Napa Cabernet Francs in memory this shows lush concentrated flavors of cherry pie red currant mocha anise and smoky spicy sandalwood that are wrapped into firm but exceptionally refined tannins. Drink now to experience the youthful beauty.,US,Cabernet Franc
This is a 100% Cabernet and its tannins are so strong that it's virtually undrinkable now. It displays class in every way with an intense concentration of cassis liqueur and blackberry that's especially deep in the middle palate but it also persists into a long spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2018 and it has the structure to go the long haul.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
A big vital wine mouth-filling and dense with plenty of weight and volume and deep flavors of earth chocolate blackberry and sweet currant. The cool '09 vintage has resulted in this version of Cask 23 being lighter in alcohol and tighter than others like the 2008. It's not quite as fat or immediately accessible as those vintages but it is very fine and should reward at least 10 years in the cellar although you can certainly drink it now after a few hours in the decanter.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
This delicious 100% Cabernet is supple and generous. The tannins are gentle the acidity soft yet supportive of the structure and as for the flavors they go beyond satisfaction into sheer delight. They include blackberry cherry blueberry currant mocha and red licorice but the wine has an earthiness and minerality that give it true complexity. This is Stag's Leap's most accessible 2009 Cabernet easily earning its high score for sheer delight. Drink now–2015.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
This will be the last Ovide from En Cerise grapes. It's an explosion of cherry and milk chocolate flavors remaining firm with expressive highlights of olive earth and herb. It is two-thirds Cabernet and one-third Syrah a perfect melding of the two grapes. Arguably one gets better aromatics than Charles Smith and the wine flavors deliver on their initial promise.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
Co-fermented with 3% Viognier this has a nice peppery lift. The fruit flavors seem less forward with the herbal components much more front and center. It's made from a clone specific to the Cougar Hill Vineyard showing cool climate flavors with subtle grace. Given a full 24 hours of breathing time it opens further into a dazzling rich mix of cherry and cassis that's soaked in an herbal broth.,US,Syrah
Tannic and closed now this wine has a tough-as-nails astringency that brings to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon one that required many years of aging. However this wine is considerably riper and fruitier than anything the mountain used to yield testimony to modern growing and extractive measures. It is in a word delicious with deep long blackberry black currant crème de cassis and smoke flavors. But like the 2007 it needs serious time in the cellar. Try after 2018.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
Concentrated and wonderfully aromatic this ages for 32 months in 75% new French oak plus another 28 months in bottle prior to its release. Smooth as silk it mixes berry cherry and plum notes with whiffs of smoke green tea and chocolate. Just past the stage of primary fruit flavors it drinks beautifully but can certainly be cellared for another decade at least.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
There aren't very many Cabernets from the small Chalk Hill appellation in eastern Sonoma County. This one is excellent a worthy follow-up to the winery's 2007 offering smooth and rich tannins with elaborate blackberry cherry cassis and mocha flavors. New oak plays a dominant role but it should recede as the wine integrates over time. Give it 6–8 years in the cellar.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
Goldschmidt has held this single-vineyard Cabernet back for more than five years an expensive proposition. And it needs even more time. Although it's magnificent the parts haven't yet come together. It's massive in blackberry and cassis liqueur flavors and the tannins are pure Alexander Valley—soft and herbal—but the oak sticks out like a sore thumb. Put it in the cellar until at least 2018 and it could go far beyond that.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
This classy Syrah opens with a note of pretty funkiness wrapped around stiff tight rather herbal flavors. The berry flavor is ripe but in no way jammy. Here the emphasis is on nuance earthiness and herbal details.,US,Syrah
There's a lot of lees influence on this wine which gives it a sourdough taste and creamy mouthfeel. It's dense in tropical fruit citrus green apple and honey notes with a touch of sweet smoky oak. A dry complex multilayered wine this will gain traction with 2–4 years in the cellar.,US,Chardonnay
Another great Hillside Select from selected blocks in Shafer's vineyard. It's a perfect illustration of the “iron fist in a velvet glove” description of Stags Leap Cabernet with perhaps more emphasis this year on the velvet than the iron. With smooth tannins and luxurious oak-influenced blackberry and black cherry jam flavors it's delicious now and will provide plenty of pleasure over the next 8–10 years.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
This is pure Cabernet—tight tannic and terroir-driven. It has a dense mix of fruit rock earth and herb flavors that are nicely integrated with a full palate and fine complexity and density. A little more barrel toast would put the icing on the cake.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
The vineyard straddles Atlas Peak and the Pritchard Hill region and this beautiful Cabernet shows its terroir in the firm tannins and ripe complex flavors.

Lush plush and absolutely delicious this shows a range of softly approachable flavors including blackberry cherry currant anise cocoa mineral buttery oak and spice. The tannins are thick but finely ground. It's firmly set in the modern cult style and may not be an ager but it sure impresses now.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
Quietly Hewitt flies below the radar often producing Cabernets that while not cheap rival their pricier competition. Consider their '09 a deal. It's dry smoothly tannic and complex offering waves of black cherry jam mocha licorice and smoky oak. You can drink this lovely wine now but it should develop in the bottle over the next 10 years.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
From the acclaimed Champoux vineyard this puts the purple fruit in a wrap of pretty baking spices. Barrel aging adds cocoa and coffee while the acidity is sufficient to keep the wine from feeling too tannic. Another couple of years of bottle age—or brisk decanting—should put it at its peak.,US,Petit Verdot
Distinctive and generous this white Rhône-style wine is made from Sierra Foothills grapes by a seasoned Napa winemaker. It tastes like vanilla hazelnuts and pears has a creamy texture feels layered with fruit and spice notes and has good acidity balanced by richness of flavor.,US,White Blend

Winemaker Anna Monticelli spent a harvest at Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux and worked under Philippe Melka at Seavey and Bryant Family.

This is a delicious Chardonay. It dances in pear peach and lemon notes. Balanced and addictive it's easy to love and not overly complicated at all. Encased in just enough oak to provide texture and weight this is a great wine for parties or casual dinners pairable with just about anything.,US,Chardonnay

There's been no price increase for this outstanding value but the quality keeps going up and up. It's packed with juicy red berry and cassis fruit—supple tangy deep and lingering.

Sanguine and brawny it's concentrated in dark plum and blueberry fruit with an earthy element teasing around the edges. The finish is marked by power and grip.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
This vintage of the winery's Sauvignon Blanc doesn't reflect the tropicality that's started to define the region. It has more warmth to the nose than the grassy pungency common elsewhere but the stronger differences are on the palate with cooked apple squeezed lemon and a brisk acidity though not a particularly long finish. Altogether this is a mellow subdued wine.,US,Sauvignon Blanc

An aromatically appealing wine with notes of cinnamon chocolate and cherry. Unfortunately it's quite tart with grainy somewhat bitter tannins.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
In Spain Albariño is usually a steely bone dry sea-inflected white wine. Here it is made in an off-dry style with 10 g/L residual sugar. The sweetness masks any apparent varietal specificity resulting in a pleasant but generic white wine.,US,Albariño
The winery doesn't tell us what the blend is but it tastes vaguely Rhônish. It's dry velvety and forward in cherry pie mocha and spice flavors wrapped into firm tannins. It's a little hot in alcohol. Drink up.,US,Red Blend

This straddles the border between an off-dry table wine and a dessert wine. It's crisp in acidity with candied orange golden apricot and honey flavors. You could certainly drink it with cookies and fruits but it's just dry enough to stand up to squash baked with brown sugar and a piece of grilled chicken.,US,Moscato

Baked black cherry rare roast beef and light sage aromas show on the dynamic earthy nose of this bottling by Winemaker Paul Clifton.

It's rare to see varietal Carmenère outside of Chile let alone in Long Island and such a great surprise when it's as tasty as this. It's lusciously fruity yet pristinely fresh boasting crisp black-plum and cherry flavors that penetrate deeply on the palate. A herbaceous swathe of green leaf and bramble only accentuates the freshness. Fine firm tannins need a few years to meld. Hold until 2020.,US,Carmenère

Intense flavors of cherry plum cassis and pepper and a finish of piquant spices and oak are equally satisfying. Based on how this wine responded to air we say give it a few years to settle down.,US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon with the other Bordeaux grapes filling in the rest. Though this 2006 vintage was held back for some time to allow for extra bottle age this is still a hard tannic wine that requires decanting. The build-out is well done tannins firm and moderately ripe fruit flavors Bordeaux-like. Right now it's a bit monolithic tasty enough but without the textural interest that most Abacela wines display.,US,Claret
Although there's no oak on this wine it has a spicy smokiness that could come from a drop of Grenache.

This isn't a great wine but it is a unique one especially for Santa Rita Hills.,US,Sauvignon Blanc

Light strawberry and black cherry fruit is the story here backed with decent acidity. Tannins are dark and well-structured so the wine keeps its balance.

Your best bet is to cellar it but its future is uncertain given the initial irregularities.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
Anywhere but in Oregon this could be labeled Pinot Noir which makes up 80% of the blend; the rest is Zinfandel. It's a combination that makes sense in the Columbia Gorge.

The result is a wine tasting of wild cherries tart spicy and quite quaffable.,US,Red Blend
This Pinot bears only the simple regional Carneros appellation but it has the rich texture and complex flavors of a vineyard-designated wine.

So bright and zingy in acidity and so ripe in tangerine mango lime fruit and honeysuckle that you hardly notice the oak influence. Yet it's there in the form of buttered toast. The result is a big powerful Chardonnay clean and vibrant for drinking now with dramatic shellfish and pork dishes.,US,Chardonnay

This is the best Obsidian Cab since the 2002 and for similar reasons. It was a good vintage for Cabernet.

Provides more evidence that this Red Hills of Lake County appellation has enormous potential for Cabernet.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
A fantastic Sauvignon Blanc. Tastes as fresh and vibrant as a young wine can with exuberant flavors of pineapples green apples cloves vanilla and cinnamon that are wrapped into a rich creamy texture.

The vineyard is Von Strasser's highest on the mountain which maximally exposes it to the sun and you can taste the solar ripeness in the intense essence of black currants and dark chocolate. The tannins exhibit classic Diamond Mountain potency. This is a dense Cabernet that needs serious time in the cellar. Hold until 2019 and it will continue to develop for many years afterward.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
Black and viscous this gorgeous Petite Sirah is intriguing in every way. Opening with aromas of just-muddled mint and freshly baked bread this wine tastes as if wildflowers and brambly blackberry stems were placed carefully in a leather satchel. No doubt this Petite will get even more interesting with age.,US,Petite Sirah
This tastes like a more concentrated and sweeter version of Stottle's dry Viognier from the same vintage and vineyard. Deeply concentrated complex and creamy it's loaded with citrus and stone fruits honey and butterscotch yet remains lifted by defining acidity.,US,Viognier
Dense and extracted this dark loamy Pinot Noir is concentrated and challenging. The fruit is black compact and sheathed in flavors of loam. Layers are tight and a bit unyielding. There is depth and power here but it must be extracted over time and with a bit of patience.,US,Pinot Noir
Extraordinarily sweet and attractive in raspberry and cherry fruit as concentrated and pure as anything in California. The acidity is beautiful as you'd expect from this vineyard in such a cool vintage and it showcases Pinot Noir's silkiness and beauty. Despite the immediate flash  it will develop bottle complexity; hold until 2016.,US,Pinot Noir
This is a barrel selection presumably limited in cases. It's an extraordinarily rich concentrated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon made in the modern cult-style of massively extracted blackberries black currants cassis liqueur and chocolate with oak bringing the usual sweet toast and vanilla complexities. This deserves its high score for sheer opulence and great Napa structure. Delicious now and could easily age for at least 10 years.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
Capture continues to make progress in interpreting their vineyard located in this new appellation a high elevation overlooking Alexander Valley. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon this Bordeaux-style blend is young now with hard tannins that interfere with the fruit. The fruit is intensely concentrated with cherry compote and cassis flavors while new oak's vanilla and toast are proportionate to the wine's volume. A worthy followup to the 2009 and a wine to cellar for 8–10 years if not longer.,US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
All Leonetti wines are 100% estate-grown fruit mixing Seven Hills Mill Creek Upland and Loess vineyard grapes.

This exceptional wine was made by the late David Lett to celebrate the birth of his granddaughter. It's drinking beautifully and has the color and scent of a mature wine though Eyrie Pinots can often live longer than those who bet against them.

Only the second release from this young vineyard it's an intensely interesting complex wine that will reward cellaring. Best after 2019.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
The trick with getting a Chardonnay this honeyed is to keep it balanced and make it finish dry. Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity partly the stony crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits melons sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak. In lesser hands it would all be too much.,US,Chardonnay

That sounds like a wild assortment  but somehow it all comes together in a wine of singular focus and discernment. Drink now–2020.,US,Pinot Noir
Gary Farrell is one of the few wineries to obtain fruit from this coveted vineyard. As always the wine is intensely concentrated in tropical fruits green apples and pears with such weight that it can easily handle lavish new French oak.

This gorgeous evocation of Russian River Chardonnay is flashy and delicious now but the window of opportunity seems to be between 2014–2017 before the fruit starts to fade away.,US,Chardonnay
What a great follow-up to the 2009 vintage. You can put this in the cellar with entire confidence that it will age for likely 10–20 years and actually improve. At nearly three years of age it's rich and vibrant with black currants blueberries and dark chocolate and a big hit of sweet oak. But the tannins are impossible locking the mouth down with astringency. It's a pity that most of the 2l064 bottles produced will probably be opened too young.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon

A blend of Sangiovese (42%) Merlot (32%) and Cabernet Sauvignon this is one of the first wines coming off the estate vineyard located next to the winery.

The palate shows the brightness of acidity that this region of the valley is known for heightening the fruit flavors and stretching out the finish.,US,Red Blend
This is an orange wine intentionally oxidized and left in barrel for two years. It's very much like a fino Sherry with comparable aromatics. What truly distinguishes this effort is the finish that lingers and develops more and more nuances for several minutes.

An outstanding Cabernet that shows its pedigreed origin in every respect. The aroma is profound with black currants flavors deep and concentrated and tannins as smooth and complex as Napa can produce.

Though quite different stylistically from the 2009 this is just as good. The structure in 2010 is noteworthy for its high acid focus. There are streaks of berry and cassis with touches of smoke and espresso. This is a wine to cellar while you are drinking up the delicious 2009.,US,Syrah
It's rare that domestic Chardonnay is truly Chablis-like but this delicately framed wine fits that description perfectly.

It's enormously rich and ripe in cherry red currant and cola sprinkled with dusty exotic spice and a hint of forest herb. The vineyard is the former Maritime Vineyard of the W.H.

A great vintage for the Sundance Red this is 43% Cabernet Sauvignon 25% Merlot 18% Cabernet Franc and 14% Syrah. The addition of Syrah really livens up the mix.

Doesn't seem to be a longterm ager so drink now–2015.,US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

A gluey aroma follows through cloaking simple sour flavors of lemon tea in its wake. There is an off flavor in the finish that doesn't subside.,US,Riesling
This wine of unknown grape varieties shows a thread of sweet cola and vanilla throughout a larger tunnel of smoky char remaining somewhat flat bitter and simple on the palate.,US,Red Blend
This dull tired wine is quickly moving past drinkability. Flat and lifeless it hints at leather and little else.,US,Pinot Noir

Grass herb and passion-fruit aromas are followed by citrus and tropical flavors. It's pleasant but the concentration seems lacking.,US,Sauvignon Blanc

Expensive but all the proceeds are for charity.,US,Pinot Noir
Bold and forward this estate-grown Syrah fairly explodes with scents of game cured meat and smoke. The black cherry and cassis fruit forms a dense and sappy core; as the wine skips across the tongue nuances of tobacco sweet leather chocolate and spices come into play. It just keeps on going adding caramel and peppery chocolate through an evolving and satisfying finish.,US,Syrah
More powerful and potent than the '04 this simply has more juice more depth more power and more detail than any previous Sheridan wine. The fruit is exceptional—dense black cherry and cassis with a sense of compact layering that promises great aging potential. This was 30 months in oak but does not seem oaky in any way. It already has the balance the polish and the length to justify long-term cellaring. Tannins are ripe and supple bringing in hints of dried herb and black olive.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
Made from 100% Cab this wine pours inky black and feels softly ripe in the mouth with pie-filling blackberries cherries mocha plums tobacco and sweet dusty spices. Shows a tannic astringency that strongly suggests cellaring although it's flashy now. Best after 2011 and beyond.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
This is a mix of 56% Sagemoor and 41% Champoux Cabernet with a 3% splash of estate Petit Verdot. It's detailed in the manner of a Pauillac thick cassis fruit with deep veins of iron cedar licorice and a just a hint of silage. The fruit is dark and dense but with breathing you'll find it begins to open into a splendid blend of black cherry cassis and mountain berry flavor. Woodward Canyon's red wines age beautifully but if drunk young give them a lot of breathing time.,US,Cabernet Sauvignon
